# "NO-TOUCH-Door-Lock"
Due to the pandemic, we all are facing the issue of not touching things like door handles, door knobs, etc. This is a small and simple project which was inspired by the idea of opening doors without touching the door handle. 
This is purely based of Arduino microcontroller. This can be implemented in a lot of ways here it is implemented with the help of servo motor just for representation of the idea.


Requirements:
1. Arduino uno r3 
2. Ultrasonic sensor 
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper Wires 
5. Servo motor
