# "NO-TOUCH-Door-Lock"
Amid the pandemic, the need to avoid touching surfaces such as door handles and knobs has become a concern. To address this issue, a simple Arduino-based project has been developed, inspired by the concept of touchless door opening. This project utilizes a servo motor for illustrative purposes, but can be implemented in various ways.

## Hardware Requirements:
1. Arduino uno r3 
2. Ultrasonic sensor 
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper Wires 
5. Servo motor
